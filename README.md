## What it does

## Why WTP was built?

Although packing became a daily routine as cabin crew, It still feels tedious and time consuming. I have always thought that I could shorten this process. What if there was an app where a user can check the forecast of a destination, get a default item list the user saved and also suggestions for weather specific items at one go? This is why I decided to build this app, to "automate boring things".

## How WTP was built

### Development tools

1. _React Router Dom_ to define routes and handle navigation in this web app, creating a smooth SPA experience.
2. _Redux_ for centralized state management in a single store.
3. _Redux Toolkit_ to simplify working with Redux in React app and to make debugging easier.
4. _[Location API](https://rapidapi.com/wirefreethought/api/geodb-cities)_ to search destinations by name.
5. _[Weather API](https://rapidapi.com/weatherapi/api/weatherapi-com/)_ to current weather and forecast data.

### Design planning with Figma

After having an rough idea to build **WTP**, I created a initial design using Figma.

## Challenges I faced and how I solved them.

## Future features

- Auto suggestions for different climates and weather condition:

After checking the minimum and maximum temperature of the destination, **WTP** can give you some recommendations to pack. For instance, it the minimum temperature was below 0 Â°C, items like winter jackets, gloves and a knitted hat will be added to your clothing list.

- Customized default list:

It is surely not that it is only the cabin crew who travel often. With the addition of the feature to edit the default items and categories, any frequent travelers can customize the list as they want.

## Development
